Voor 11/05:

    -in C++, there is a common memory across the whole program, using the same random number
    everywhere in each iteration in runSimulations but not in java

    -we tried to make a getter and setter to get the seed from the iteration into the helper
    class so that this would to the same, but it does not work

    -we tried to give the seed as a parameter to all the functions but didn't work

    -we tried to create a function that gives back a random for each seed but didn't work

    --> problem: when getting the seed into helper, it does not change, while the seed in simulation is changing


    2nd problem: ones we get the same random number everywhere, you cannot do arithmetic operations on a random
    so I use random.nextfloat to calculate the complementary random number

    3rd problem: ones that is done, I don't understand where else in the program a random number is used, only
    in the helper class, to calculate the new OV





       public void getIterator(int seed) {
            //System.out.println("This is the seed  "+ setSeed);
            setSeed = seed;
        }

        public int getSeed() {
            //int test = setSeed;
            //System.out.println("TEST:  "+ test);
            return setSeed;
        }

        public Random generateRand(int seed){
            Random rand = new Random();
            seed = setSeed;
            //System.out.println("This is the seed  "+ setSeed);
            rand.setSeed(seed);
            return rand;
        }
